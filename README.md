# terragrunt-aws-template
A template project for a terraform / terragrunt project for AWS, using the best practices I've learnt as a DevOps engineer on AWS migration projects.

The project is set up with a basic project structure. Each folder contains a readme to explain what the folder is for and what should go inside it.
